# Introduction

<div class=notes>
These notes will examine the incorportion of machine learning
methods in classic econometric techniques for estimating causal
effects. More specifally, we will focus on estimating treatment
effects using matching and instrumental variables. In these
estimators (and many others) there is a low-dimensional parameter
of interest, such as the average treatment effect, but estimating
it requires also estimating a potentially high dimensional
nuisance parameter, such as the propensity score. Machine learning
methods were developed for prediction with high dimensional
data. It is then natural to try to use machine learning for
estimating high dimensional nuisance parameters. Care must be
taken when doing so though because the flexibility and complexity
that make machine learning so good at prediction also pose
challenges for inference.

## Example: partially linear model

$$
    y_i = \theta d_i + f(x_i) + \epsilon_i
$$

- Interested in $\theta$
- Assume $\Er[\epsilon|d,x] = 0$
- Nuisance parameter $f()$
- E.g. @donohue2001

<div class=notes>
The simplest example of the setting we will analyze is a partially
linear model. We have some regressor of interest, $d$, and we want
to estimate the effect of $d$ on $y$. We have a rich enough set of
controls that we are willing to believe that $\Er[\epsilon|d,x] =
0$. $d_i$ and $y_i$ are scalars, while $x_i$ is a vector. We are
not interested in $x$ per se, but we need to include it to avoid
omitted variable bias.

Typical applied econometric practice would
be to choose some transfrom of $x$, say $X = T(x)$, where $X$
could be some subset of $x$, along with interactions, powers, and
so on. Then estimate a linear regression
$$
y = \theta d + X'\beta + \epsilon
$$
and then perhaps also report results for a handful of different
choices of $T(x)$.

Some downsides to the typical applied econometric practice
include:

- The choice of T is arbitrary, which opens the door to specification
searching and p-hacking.

- If $x$ is high dimensional, and $X$ is low dimensional, a poor
choice will lead to omitted variable bias. Even if $x$ is low
dimensional, if $f(x)$ is poorly approximated by $X'\beta$,
there will be omitted variable bias.

In some sense, machine learning can be thought of as a way to
choose $T$ is an automated and data-driven way. There will be
still be a choice of machine learning method and often tuning
parameters for that method, so some arbitrary decisions
remain. Hopefully though these decisions have less impact.

You may already be familiar with traditional nonparametric
econometric methods like series / sieves and kernels. These share
much in common with machine learning. What makes
machine learning different that traditional nonparametric methods?
Machine learning methods appear to have better predictive
performance, and arguably more practical data-driven methods to choose
tuning parameters. Machine learning methods can deal with high
dimensional $x$, while traditional nonparametric methods focus on
situations with low dimensional $x$.

**Example : Effect of abortion on crime**

@donohue2001 estimate a regression of state crime rates on
crime type relevant abortion rates and controls,
$$
y_{it} = \theta a_{it} + x_{it}'\beta + \delta_i + \gamma_t +
\epsilon_{it}.
$$
$a_{it}$ is a weighted average of lagged abortion rates in
state $i$, with the weight on the $\ell$th lag equal to the
fraction of age $\ell$ people who commit a given crime type. The
covariates $x$ are  the log of lagged prisoners per capita, the
log of lagged police per capita, the unemployment rate, per-capita
income, the poverty rate, AFDC generosity at time t − 15, a dummy
for concealed weapons law, and beer consumption per
cap. @belloni2014 reanalyze this setup using lasso to allow a more
flexible specification of controls. They allow for many
interactions and quadratic terms, leading to 284 controls.

## Example: Matching

- Binary treatment $d_i \in \{0,1\}$
- Potential outcomes $y_i(0), y_i(1)$, observe $y_i = y_i(d_i)$
- Interested in average treatment effect : $\theta = \Er[y_i(1) -
  y_i(0)]$
- Covariates $x_i$
- Assume unconfoundedness : $d_i \indep y_i(1), y_i(0) | x_i$
- E.g. @connors1996

<div class=notes>
The partially linear and matching models are
closely related. If the conditional mean independence assumption
of the partially linear model is strengthing to conditional
indepence then the partially linear model is a special case of the
matching model with constant treatment effects,
$y_i(1) - y_i(0) = \theta$.
Thus the matching model can be viewed as a generalization
of the partially linear model that allows for treatment effect
heterogeneity.
</div>

<!-- --- -->

## Example: Matching

- Estimatable formulae for ATE :
$$
\begin{align*}
  \theta = & \Er\left[\frac{y_i d_i}{\Pr(d = 1 | x_i)} - \frac{y_i
      (1-d_i)}{1-\Pr(d=1|x_i)} \right] \\
  \theta = & \Er\left[\Er[y_i | d_i = 1, x_i] - \Er[y_i | d_i = 0 , x_i]\right] \\
  \theta = & \Er\left[ \begin{array}{l} d_i \frac{y_i - \Er[y_i | d_i = 1,
      x_i]}{\Pr(d=1|x_i)} - (1-d_i)\frac{y_i - \Er[y_i | d_i = 0,
      x_i]}{1-\Pr(d=1|x_i)} + \\ + \Er[y_i | d_i = 1, x_i] - \Er[y_i | d_i = 0 ,
      x_i]\end{array}\right]
\end{align*}
$$

<div class = "notes">
All the expectations in these three formulae involve observable
data. Thus, we can form an estimate of $\theta$ be replacing the
expectations and conditional expectations with appropriate
estimators. For example, to use the first formula, we could
estimate a logit model for the probability of treatment,
$$
\hat{\Pr}(d=1|x_i) = \frac{e^{X_i' \hat{\beta}}}{1+e^{X_i'\hat{\beta}}}
$$
where, as above, $X$ is a some chosen transformation of
$x_i$. Then we simply take an average to estimate $\theta$.
$$
\hat{\theta} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{y_i d_i}{\hat{\Pr}(d=1|x_i)} -
\frac{y_i(1-d_i)} {1-\hat{\Pr}(d=1|x_i)}
$$
As in the partially linear model, estimating the parameter of
interest, $\theta$, requires estimating a potentially high
dimensional nuisance parameter, in this case
$\hat{\Pr}(d=1|x)$. Similarly, the second expression would require
estimating conditional expectations of $y$ as nuisance
parameters. The third expression requires estimating both
conditional expecations of $y$ and $d$.

The third expression might appear needlessly complicated, but we
will see later that it has some desirable properties that will
make using it essential when very flexible machine learning
estimators for the conditional expectations are used.

The origin of the name "matching" can be seen in the second
expression. One way to estimate that expression would be to take
each person in the treatment group, find someone with the same (or
nearly the same) $x$
in the control group, difference the outcome of this matched pair,
and then average over the whole sample. (Actually this gives the
average treatment effect on the treated. For the ATE, you would
also have to do the same with roles of the groups switched and
average all the differences.) When $x$ is multi-dimensional, there
is some ambiguity about what it means for two $x$ values to be
nearly the same. An important insight of @rosenbaum1983 is that it
is sufficient to match on the propensity score, $P(d=1|x)$,
instead.

**Example: effectiveness of heart catheterization**

@connors1996 use matching to estimate the effectiveness of heart
catheterization in critically ill patients. Their dataset contains
5735 patients and 72 covariates. @athey2017b reanalyze this data
using a variety of machine learning methods.

literature on matching. @imbens2015 focuses on practical advice

learning.

Both the partially linear model and treatment effects model can be
extended to situations with endogeneity and instrumental
variables.

## Example: IV

$$
\begin{align*}
y_i = & \theta d_i + f(x_i) + \epsilon_i \\
d_i = & g(x_i, z_i) + u_i
\end{align*}
$$

- Interested in $\theta$
- Assume $\Er[\epsilon|x,z] = 0$, $\Er[u|x,z]=0$
- Nuisance parameters $f()$, $g()$
- E.g. @angrist1991

<div class=notes>
Most of the remarks about the partially linear model also apply
here.

@hartford2017 estimate a generalization of this model with $y_i =
f(d_i, x_i) +\epsilon$ using deep neural networks.

**Example : compulsory schooling and earnings**

@angrist1991 use quarter of birth as an instrument for years of
schooling to estimate the effect of schooling on earnings. Since
compulsory schooling laws typically specify a minimum age at which
a person can leave school instead of a minimum years of schooling,
people born at different times of the year can be required to
complete one more or one less year of schooling. Compulsory
schooling laws and their effect on attained schooling can vary
with state and year. Hence, @angrist1991 considered specifying
$g(x,z)$ as all interactions of quarter of birth, state, and year
dummies. Having so many instruments leads to statistical problems
with 2SLS.

## Example: LATE

- Binary instrumet $z_i \in \{0,1\}$
- Potential treatments $d_i(0), d_i(1) \in \{0,1\}$, $d_i = d_i(Z_i)$
- Potential outcomes $y_i(0), y_i(1)$, observe $y_i = y_i(d_i)$
- Covariates $x_i$
- $(y_i(1), y_i(0), d_i(1), d_i(0)) \indep z_i | x_i$
- Local average treatment effect:
$$
\begin{align*}
\theta = & \Er\left[\Er[y_i(1) - y_i(0) | x, d_i(1) > d_i(0)]\right] \\
       = & \Er\left[\frac{\Er[y|z=1,x] - \Er[y|z=0,x]}
                      {\Er[d|z=1,x]-\Er[d|z=0,x]} \right]
\end{align*}
$$

<div class=notes>
See @abadie2003.

@belloni2017 analyze estimation of this model using Lasso and other
machine learning methods.
</div>
<!-- --- -->

## General setup

- Parameter of interest $\theta \in \R^{d_\theta}$

- Nuisance parameter $\eta \in T$

- Moment conditions
$$
\Er[\psi(W;\theta_0,\eta_0) ] = 0 \in \R^{d_\theta}
$$
with $\psi$ known

- Estimate $\hat{\eta}$ using some machine learning method

- Estimate $\hat{\theta}$ from
$$
\En[\psi(w_i;\hat{\theta},\hat{\eta}) ] = 0
$$

<div class=notes>
We are following the setup and notation of
@chernozhukov2018. As in the examples, the dimension of $\theta$
is fixed and small. The dimension of $\eta$ is large and might be
increasing with sample size. $T$ is some normed vector space.
</div>

### Example: partially linear model

$$
    y_i = \theta_0 d_i + f_0(x_i) + \epsilon_i
$$

- Compare the estimates from

    1. $\En[d_i(y_i - \tilde{\theta} d_i - \hat{f}(x_i)) ] = 0$

    and

    2. $\En[(d_i - \hat{m}(x_i))(y_i - \hat{\mu}(x_i) -  \theta (d_i - \hat{m}(x_i)))] = 0$

    where $m(x) = \Er[d|x]$ and $\mu(y) = \Er[y|x]$

<div class=notes>
**Example: partially linear model**
In the partially linear model,

$$
    y_i = \theta_0 d_i + f_0(x_i) + \epsilon_i
$$

we can let $w_i = (y_i, x_i)$ and $\eta = f$.  There are a variety of
candidates for $\psi$. An obvious (but flawed) one is $\psi(w_i; \theta,
\eta) = (y_i - \theta_0 d_i - f_0(x_i))d_i$. With this choice of
$\psi$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
0 = & \En[d_i(y_i - \hat{\theta} d_i - \hat{f}(x_i)) ] \\
\hat{\theta} = & \En[d_i^2]^{-1} \En[d_i (y_i - \hat{f}(x_i))] \\
(\hat{\theta} - \theta_0) = &  \En[d_i^2]^{-1} \En[d_i \epsilon_i] +
    \En[d_i^2]^{-1} \En[d_i (f_0(x_i) - \hat{f}(x_i))]
\end{align*}
$$

The first term of this expression is quite promising. $d_i$ and
$\epsilon_i$ are both finite dimensional random variables, so a
law of large numbers will apply to $\En[d_i^2]$, and a central limit
theorem would apply to $\sqrt{n} \En[d_i \epsilon_i]$. Unfortunately,
the second expression is problematic. To accomodate high dimensional
$x$ and allow for flexible $f()$, machine learning estimators must
introduce some sort of regularization to control variance. This
regularization also introduces some bias. The bias generally vanishes,
but at a slower than $\sqrt{n}$ rate. Hence

$$
\sqrt{n} \En[d_i (f_0(x_i) - \hat{f}(x_i))] \to \infty.
$$

To get around this problem, we must modify our estimate of
$\theta$. Let $m(x) = \Er[d|x]$ and $\mu(y) = \Er[y|x]$. Let
$\hat{m}()$ and $\hat{\mu}()$ be some estimates. Then we can estimate
$\theta$ by partialling out:

$$
\begin{align*}
0 = & \En[(d_i - \hat{m}(x_i))(y_i - \hat{\mu}(x_i) -  \theta (d_i - \hat{m}(x_i)))] \\
\hat{\theta} = & \En[(d_i -\hat{m}(x_i))^2]^{-1} \En[(d_i -
\hat{m}(x_i))(y_i - \hat{\mu}(x_i))] \\
(\hat{\theta} - \theta_0) = & \En[(d_i -\hat{m}(x_i))^2]^{-1} \left(\En[(d_i -
\hat{m}(x_i))\epsilon_i] + \En[(d_i - \hat{m}(x_i))(\mu(x_i) -
\hat{\mu}(x_i))] \right) \\
= & \En[(d_i -\hat{m}(x_i))^2]^{-1} \left( a + b +c + d \right)
\end{align*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{align*}
a = & \En[(d_i -m(x_i))\epsilon_i] \\
b = & \En[(m(x_i)-\hat{m}(x_i))\epsilon_i] \\
c = & \En[v_i(\mu(x_i) - \hat{\mu}(x_i))] \\
d = & \En[(m(x_i) - \hat{m}(x_i))(\mu(x_i) - \hat{\mu}(x_i))]
\end{align*}
$$

with $v_i = d_i - \Er[d_i | x_i]$. The term $a$ is well behaved and
$\sqrt{n}a \leadsto N(0,\Sigma)$ under standard conditions. Although
terms $b$ and $c$ appear similar to the problematic term in the
initial estimator, they are better behaved because $\Er[v|x] = 0$ and
$\Er[\epsilon|x] = 0$. This makes it possible, but difficult to show
that $\sqrt{n}b \to_p = 0$ and $\sqrt{n} c \to_p = 0$, see
e.g. @belloni2014. However, the conditions on $\hat{m}$ and
$\hat{\mu}$ needed to show this are slightly restrictive, and
appropriate conditions might not be known for all estimators.
@chernozhukov2018 describe a sample splitting modification to
$\hat{\theta}$ that allows $\sqrt{n} b$ and $\sqrt{n} c$ to vanish
under weaker conditions (essentially the same rate condition as needed
for $\sqrt{n} d$ to vanish.)

The last term, $d$, is a considerable improvement upon the first
estimator. Instead of involving the error in one estimate, it now
involes the product of the error in two estimates. By the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
$$
d \leq \sqrt{\En[(m(x_i) - \hat{m}(x_i))^2]} \sqrt{\En[(\mu(x_i) - \hat{\mu}(x_i))^2]}.
$$
So if the estimates of $m$ and $\mu$ converge at rates faster than
$n^{-1/4}$, then $\sqrt{n} d \to_p 0$. This $n^{-1/4}$ rate is reached
by many machine learning estimators.
</div>

### Lessons from the example

- Need an extra condition on moments -- Neyman orthogonality
$$
\partial \eta \Er[\psi(W;\theta_0,\eta_0)](\eta-\eta_0) = 0
$$

- Want estimators faster than $n^{-1/4}$ in the prediction norm,
$$
\sqrt{\En[(\hat{\eta}(x_i) - \eta(x_i))^2]} \lesssim_P n^{-1/4}
$$

- Also want estimators that satisfy something like
$$ \sqrt{n} \En[(\eta(x_i)-\hat{\eta}(x_i))\epsilon_i] = o_p(1) $$
    - Sample splitting will make this easier
